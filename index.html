    <p>This document describes a possible best practice for creating a SKOS thesaurus based on the experiences of the PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus Working Group using the new PLDN Linked Data Thesaurus as a working example in this document. No section in this document is normative, it's only informative, decribing 'all' possible design decisions that you can make while creating a new small thesaurus, also in relation to other PLDN and external vocabularies and datasets.<br>

    <p>The <dfn>Foo</dfn> interface represents a {{Foo}}.</p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>doTheFoo()</dfn> method does the foo. Call it by running
      {{Foo/doTheFoo()}}.
